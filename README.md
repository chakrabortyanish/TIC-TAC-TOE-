# TIC-TAC-TOE-
My site is live at https://chakrabortyanish-tic-tac-toe-2024.netlify.app<br>
A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT. The game allows two players to play against each other on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks (X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. This project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts like logic building, conditional statements, and DOM manipulation.
